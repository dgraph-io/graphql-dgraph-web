* Drop data allows you to reset your Slash GraphQL backend and start from a clean slate. You can reuse the same endpoint and start all over again. *

### Dropping Data Programatically

You can drop all of your backend data while retaining the schema from the Slash GraphQL Dashboard using the `Drop Data` button under the [Settings](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/settings) tab in the sidebar.

If you would like to do this programatically, simply send a dropData mutation to your instance's admin endpoint as follows.

```sh
curl 'https://<your-backend>/admin/slash' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' \
  --data-binary 'mutation { dropData(allData: true) { response { code message } } }'
```

Refer to the [authentication](/slash-graphql/admin/authentication) doc to learn about the auth token.

If you would like to drop all data along with schema, then use the following snippet.

```sh
curl 'https://<your-backend>/admin/slash' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' \
  --data-binary 'mutation { dropData(allDataAndSchema: true) { response { code message } } }'
```
